# Hello World GitOps Project

This project demonstrates a basic "Hello World" web application that is dockerized and managed using GitOps practices. The application displays a simple message through a containerized web server (Nginx) and integrates Git Hooks to validate Docker builds before committing code changes.

## Features

- **GitOps Integration**: Uses pre-commit hooks to ensure Docker image builds are validated before code commits.
- **Dockerization**: The project is containerized using Docker with a simple Nginx setup.
- **Git Hooks**: Git hooks automate the process of validating Docker builds before commits are allowed.
- **Local Deployment**: Easily run the project locally with Docker.
